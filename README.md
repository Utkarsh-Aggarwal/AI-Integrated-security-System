# AI-Integrated-security-System
This repository contains the code and implementation details for a Facial Recognition-Based Security System using Python, OpenCV, DeepFace, and an ESP32 microcontroller. The system provides secure access control by authenticating users through facial recognition and controlling a solenoid lock via a relay module.
